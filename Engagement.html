            <h2 id="section1">Thankful to be Together</h2>
            <p>
                After the first year of doing long-distance, we both loved the idea of being a 1 minute 
                walk away from each other. I was in Beebe suites and she was in Edwards. Despite the 
                difficulties Covid provided for a dating couple such as uncertainties of whether we were 
                even allowed to hold hands since we didn't live together, we found ways to spend time 
                together. We had study sessions, numerous walks around the Quad, more than 
                a handful of Super Smash Bros. tournaments, and even changing the alternator in her car. 
                We couldn't have been more thankful to be together during that time.

                Everyone was so excited we were finally engaged, but then the unexpected happened. Only 
                a few weeks after getting engaged I had some baggage from the past come up. It totally 
                shook me and took me by surprise, not to mention adding in everything else that was going 
                on at the time. I was struggling to juggle everything at the time and my fiancee, hoping 
                to take an issue off my plate (I had briefly mentioned getting married was a little
                stressful), gave me back the ring. Long story short, I was able to figure my stuff out with 
                her still by my side and we got formally engaged again. Despite the difficulty at the time, 
                that particular season only grew us closer together and closer to God.

                All seemed to be going well as we finished up Fall semester. We headed home to Olympia
                for a much-needed Winter break. During that time, we decided, much to our initial dislike, 
                that school wasn't the best course of action for her. She stayed home in Olympia while I 
                reluctantly returned to campus alone. We were used to long distance but being apart after 
                so much time together made it more difficult than anticipated. We did our best though. Then 
                the big bump came. Out of nowhere, she informed me there were two big deficiencies she saw in 
                me that made her unsure if our original wedding date of June 12 would be too soon. I felt like 
                my world was crumbling around me. I didn't see it coming. Arguably the most difficult time of 
                my life, I sought God and advice from others like never before. It was all an uphill battle 
                in the midst of finals approaching, being long-distance, unexpectedly getting Covid, and more 
                on top of that. I had no idea how I would make it through.

                God turned the situation into a masterpiece and a true testimony. Long-distance helped us 
                process what was happening individually and with others. Classes gave me a good distraction 
                from the situation. Covid even led to me living at her house with her mom for 2 weeks, giving 
                us numerous opportunities to finally have those hard talks. Long story short, we decided to 
                keep the wedding for June 12. After school ended, we were both working full time and doing 
                all the fun wedding planning. Fast forward a month, and the day we had fought tooth and nail 
                for was finally upon us. Hallelujah!
