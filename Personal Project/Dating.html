            <p>
                It all started on August 5, 2019 at 9:50pm. We had just gotten back from a mission trip 
                where sparks started to fly. Little did I know, she had her eye on me for several months 
                but was too nervous to try talking to me. On the trip is when I finally realized she was taking 
                a special notice of me, and I remember my first thought was, "I like this." After the trip 
                we talked to our parents about dating and they both gave us the OK. We were so excited! After 
                talking about what we wanted to be at a small group, we decided to settle on being boyfriend 
                and girlfriend. We shook hands to make the decision official.
            </p>

                Not even a month later I moved off to school for my first semester. Neither of us was 
                sure how starting off long distance would go, but we decided to give it a try. 
                Over that first year at school we: 
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Said 'I love you' for the first time</li>
                    <li>Brushed our teeth together every night before bed</li>
                    <li>Made long treks to see each other</li>
                    <li>Dug a massive hole by hand at the beach (true bonding)</li>
                    <li>Shared our first kiss</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, we got to know each other much better. Distance certainly made the heart grow fonder.
            </p>
            <h2 id="section3">Popping the Question</h2>
            <p>
                The following school year we were at school together. I don't even remember how it happened, 
                but all I cared about at the time was her being nearby, especially in the midst of Covid.
                We knew we wanted to get married but only talked about it. So after a trip she thought 
                was me proposing (Oops...), God placed me in a perfect situation to put together a simple 
                yet creative proposal, all planned in the course of one day. I took her on a hike to God's Thumb 
                where two of her friends were putting together a surprise picnic with her favorite snacks, 
                a blanket, and music. She was absolutely oblivious, despite accidentally parking right behind 
                her friend's car. I dropped to one knee, popped the question, and she said yes!
