                The big day had finally come! All the planning and preparation had been leading 
                up to this one day and it couldn't have been more perfect. There were no last-minute
                 scrambling or mistakes that needed to be fixed. The only minor hiccups caused no 
                 stress and were taken care of in less than 5 minutes. Camden and I were both as 
                 nervous and excited as possible (Camden said he only got 3 hours of sleep the night 
                 before). I can remember waking up in the morning and feeling nervous, excited, yet 
                 still at peace and calm. I headed to the church where Camden and I would get ready 
                 in separate buildings, until 10:00am when we would have our private first look before 
                 the ceremony. It didn't feel any different than when we saw each other normally. Of 
                 course, we were in our wedding best, but I knew this was the same Camden I've known 
                 and wanted to marry all along. The ceremony started shortly after our first look. Our 
                 friends and family supported us as we made our vows to each other and to God. After 
                 that we danced (literally) down the aisle in celebration! After that there was cake, 
                 toasts, dancing, celebration, and laughter. To be honest, I don't remember much detail, 
                 but I remember the feeling and excitement of being with friends and family. Finally, 
                 we drove off in Camden's 1997 Honda Accord as our guests threw flower petals and cheered 
                 us on as we started our new adventure.

                After the honeymoon we moved into our first house in Olympia. The first month was a little
                bumpy as the honeymoon feeling started to wear off and adulting hit us. We were both working 
                full time, with her schedule changing week and me working overtime weekly. Despite this, we 
                grew together as we figured out life together. That was the #1 thing I was looking forward to 
                in marriage, and that's exactly what we did. We were officially living on our own and off our 
                own income. We were also blessed to have family and friends all living nearby to support us 
                with anything we needed help with. After the summer we prepared to move down to Yamhill 
                for me to start school and start the next chapter.

            <p>
                I've learned so much these past four months. The most important thing I've learned is taking 
                note of what my wife finds important and enjoys doing. Despite the fact it might not be 
                something I enjoy as much, I know she finds value in wrapping aspects of her life up with me. 
                I've also had to exercise goal setting and planning in general. It takes a lot for us to get 
                through a day with energy and making sure we've checked off everything we need to. Overall, 
                I feel like it's going pretty well, especially getting to start and end each day with my best 
                friend. What a blessing our journey has been.
